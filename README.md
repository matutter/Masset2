This is a NodeJS Backend, it tries to provide all the basics.  

## Perks 
_I wrote this with 5 things in mind_  
1. A server that **feels familiar** to beginners as an alternative to Express which is massive.  
2. Loosely follow the _server->router->handler_ model from the **Node Beginner Book**.  
3. Use a few strong tools, **SocketIO**, **Jade** templates, **MongoDB**.  
4. Do **more with some**... As apposed to a lot, ideally a little but the project grew a little more.
5. **Lightly implement** most things and keep dependencies low.
